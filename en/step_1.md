## Introduction

In this project you'll learn how to create a game in which the player has to match up coloured dots with the correct colour of the controller wheel.

--- no-print ---
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to rotate the controller wheel and catch the flying dots as they reach the centre. If you miss three dots, the game is over.
