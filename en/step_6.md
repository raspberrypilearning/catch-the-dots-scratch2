## Challenge: faster dots
Can you improve your game by adding a `speed`{:class="blockdata"} variable and using this new variable to make the dot change their speed over time? The clones should start by moving one step at a time, and then steadily get faster and faster.

The code you need for this is very similar to the code in which you've used the `delay`{:class="blockdata"} variable.
