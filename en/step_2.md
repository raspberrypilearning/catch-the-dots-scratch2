## Create a controller

Start by creating a controller that the player will use to collect dots.

--- task ---
Open the 'Catch the dots' Scratch starter project.

**Online:** open the starter project at [rpf.io/dots-on](http://rpf.io/dots-on). If you have a Scratch account, you can click on **Remix** in the top right-hand corner to save a copy of the project.

**Offline:** download the starter project from [rpf.io/dots-off](http://rpf.io/dots-off), and then open it in the Scratch offline editor.

If you need to download and install the Scratch offline editor, you can find it at [rpf.io/scratchoff](http://rpf.io/scratchoff).

Add some code tothe controller sprite to make the sprite turn right if the player presses the right arrow key:

![Controller sprite](images/controller-sprite.png)

```blocks
	when flag clicked
	forever
		if <key [right arrow v] pressed?> then
			turn right (3) degrees
		end
	end
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Test your code. The controller should spin to the right when you press the right arrow key.

Find the code that checks whether the right arrow key is pressed and makes the sprite turn right. Can you add a copy of this code, and change the copy so it checks whether the left arrow key is pressed and makes the sprite turn left?

Here is what your code should look like:
```blocks
	when flag clicked
	forever
		if <key [right arrow v] pressed?> then
			turn right (3) degrees
		end
        + if <key [left arrow v] pressed?> then
