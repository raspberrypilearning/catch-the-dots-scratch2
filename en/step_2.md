## Create a controller

Start by creating a controller that the player will use to collect dots.

--- task ---
Open the 'Catch the dots' Scratch starter project from [rpf.io/p/en/catch-the-dots-scratch2-go](http://rpf.io/p/en/catch-the-dots-scratch2-go), and then open it in the Scratch offline editor.

If you need to download and install the Scratch offline editor, you can find it at [rpf.io/scratchoff](http://rpf.io/scratchoff).

--- /task ---

You should see a controller sprite:

--- task ---
Add some code to the controller sprite to make the sprite turn right if the player presses the right arrow key:

Test your code. The controller should spin to the right when you press the right arrow key.

Add code to the controller sprite to make the sprite turn left if the player presses the left arrow key.

Find the code that checks whether the right arrow key is pressed and makes the sprite turn right. Can you add a copy of this code, and change the copy so it checks whether the left arrow key is pressed and makes the sprite turn left?
