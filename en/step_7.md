--- task ---
Add code to your custom block so that the block checks if the current value of `score`{:class="blockdata"} in larger than the value of the `high score`{:class="blockdata"} variable, and then stores the value of `score`{:class="blockdata"} as the new value of `high score`{:class="blockdata"}.

```blocks
	define [check high score]
	if <(score) > (high score)> then
		set [high score v] to (score)
	end
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Add your new custom block to the Stage script before the end of the script.

when flag clicked
set [lives v] to (3)
set [score v] to (0)
wait until <(lives) < (1)>
+ check high score :: custom
stop [all v]
```
