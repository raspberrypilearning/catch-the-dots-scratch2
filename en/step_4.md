This is how you need to change the code for the blue sprite:

If you play the game now, you can see that the dots sometimes get created one top of each other.

--- task ---
Add code to the 'yellow' dot sprite so that it waits 4 seconds after the flag is clicked before appearing.

Then add code to the 'blue' dot sprite so that it waits 6 seconds after the flag is clicked before appearing.
